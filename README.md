# rust-cicd-template

## TODO:
- pin rust and cargo version somehow (if it's meaningful and there's a way)
- don't run compilation checks and pre-compilation CI in same action as CI (or think about a logical way of how to separate this)
- think about a way to make this run the same in different environments (i.e., local vs remote) (if needed)
- add clippy config in .toml file
- add actual tests
